## Faced Problems & Solutions:

Problem 1: If we want to make an element draggable then we have to use on that element {...listeners}(import from "@dnd-kit/sortable")
Now the problem is if we add any event[exept(mouse event)] on the children element of that draggable parent then the
event handler won't work for {...listeners}. {...listeners} will block it.

Solution - 1: To work the events on children of draggable parent we have to use the children outside of the draggable
parent and use css positioning for position the children over the draggable parent.
**NOTE**: In this approach the children won't be draggable with draggable parent.

Solution - 2: Using mouseEnter & mouseLeave event on the children to deactivate the {...listeners} by applying conditions.
**NOTE**: In this approach the children will be draggable with draggable parent but draggable feature won't work on mouseEnter of
that children.
